    <h1>SparkScript Documentaion(READ THE WHOLE THING, SCROLL DOWN!)</h1>
    <p>To use sps(SparkScript) you have to have a IDE, preffered VSCODE.</p>
    <p>You must paste the interpreter path into the console where it says "interpreter path:" after you run it.</p>
    <p>Then paste your .sps file path into the cmd it opens.</p>
    <h2>.sps Syntax:</h2>
    <p>sPrint(' ') To print something to the console *MUST HAVE SINGLE QUOTES*. </p>
    <p>Most statements(keyword most, not all) will start with (spark.).</p>
    <h3>Statements consists of: </h3>
    <p>Spark.sVar var name = var value To set a variable a value and name(var names must be single letters at the moment!).</p>
    <p>Spark.sPrintvar(var name) This prints the value of a variable to the console.</p>
    <p>spark.sPrintvarT(varname) prints the variable type, numbers 0-25 are considered type "number", anything else is just considered "else"</p>
    <p>spark.mathF is the math class of which the result of ONLY SQRT(every other operation the vars stay the same) is automatically assigned to a variable(IF YOU PASSED THROUGH A VAR, YOU CAN JUST USE NORMAL NUMBERS TOO!).</p>
    <h3>spark.mathF consists of: </h3>
    <p>spark.mathF.addition(num or var+num or var) This adds together the 2 numbers, or variables you passed through the parens, prints the result.</p>
    <p>spark.mathF.mul(num or var*num or var) This multiplies together the 2 numbers, or variables you passed through the parens, prints the result.</p>
    <p>spark.mathF.divide(num or var/num or var) This divides the 1st number by the second, or variables you passed through the parens, prints the result.</p>
    <p>spark.mathF.subtraction(num or var-num or var) This subtracts the 2nd number from the 1st, or variables you passed through the parens, prints the result.</p>
    <p>spark.mathF.sqrt(num or var) This finds the square root of the number you passed through the parens, and if its a variable it automatically replaces the value of it with the result, and prints it to the console.</p>
    <h3>spark.mathnoreF.sqrt</h3>
    <p>mathnoreF only has one member, sprt, which it finds the square root of the number or var, but does not replace its value.</p>
    <p>mathnoreF stands for math no reassign function.</p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>Functions can be made and called whenever in your script, but atm they only accept one argument :(.</p>
    <p>You can write functions by writing newFunc functionname {whatever sps code you wants to execute}.</p>
    <p>You can call these functions by writing call functionname.</p>
    <h3>Waiting</h3>
    <p>You can make your script wait before executing the next code line by writing spark.wait(how many seconds to wait).</p>
    <h3>Creating windows</h3>
    <p>To create a window write spark.createWindow(window name).</p>
    <p>You can add a label to the window by writing spark.newLabel('windowname', 'labeltext', 'fontname', 'fontsize'). </p>
    <p>You can open the window by writing open windowname.</p>
    <h3>System fucntions</h3>
    <p>You can run system commands by wriiting spark.os.command system command to run.</p>
    <p>You can get detectm input(only handles one) by writing spark.getIn whatever key to detect, and it will print the key that was pressed to the cmd console</p>
    <p>You can open webpages by writing spark.openWeb(Website to open).</p>
    <h3>Lastly, comments</h3>
    <p>Lastly, to write comments just write a <b>//</b> before whatever comment you write.</p>
